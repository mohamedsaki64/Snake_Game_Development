# Designed and implemented a Snake Game using ILI9341 display and a joystick. The game will feature multiple levels, each increasing in complexity. The features are as follows,
Using a joystick snake movements are being controlled in four directions (North, East, South, West)
The Snake changes its direction according to joystick input.
Food appears randomly on the screen.
The length of the snake is being incremented by 1 unit once it eats the food.
A barrier appears at random places.
There two conditions for GameOver, one is if the snake touches itself and if the snake hit the barrier
The game has no walls therefore, if the snake enters one side of the display it appears again from the opposite side.
Each food consumed adds 1 point to the score, displayed in a corner.
There are 5 levels in this game, 
  i. Game starts at level one and food appears, after each two points level get incremented.
  ii. At level 2, A barried (digit-2) appears on screen randomly.
  iii. At level 3, A counter is introduced for food and it disppears after 5s.
  iv. Negative food appears, decreasing the game score once being eaten.
  v. From level 5, above speed increases by 20% for each level.
